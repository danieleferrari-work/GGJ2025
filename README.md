GLOBAL GAME JAM 2025
Theme: Bubbles

A simple prototype of a local 1v1 shooter created in less than 48 hours.

It's a bubble battle between two children. Players can move around a circular arena and must consume oxygen to shoot bubbles. The amount of oxygen you have also determines how much space you can move in the arena: the less oxygen you have, the less space you can occupy. You lose oxygen when the opponent hits you.
